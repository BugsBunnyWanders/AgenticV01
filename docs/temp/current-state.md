# Project Status

## Tasks Done
- Implemented client-side audio pause on interruption.
- Revamped UI for a more advanced/techy look (dark theme, sphere canvas, new controls, "FRIDAY - Interface" header, status display).
- Implemented 3D particle sphere animation with wavy effect when agent speaks.
- Implemented Wake Word ("Hey Friday") functionality with app state management and Web Speech API.
- Addressed `WebSocketDisconnect` errors with asynchronous operations and improved error handling in audio initialization.
- Fixed "Initializing..." message getting stuck by ensuring DOM elements are assigned on `window.load` and deferring canvas setup.
- Resolved `TypeError` caused by an obsolete event listener.
- Added detailed console logging for diagnosing wake word detection and session activation issues.
- Shifted session termination logic: Client now relies on the agent (server) to close the WebSocket connection upon recognizing "Bye Friday".
- Implemented a manual "Stop Session" button functionality by repurposing the existing `voiceControlButton`:
  - Button text and behavior change dynamically based on `appState` (session active vs. not active).
  - Allows user to explicitly terminate an active session via UI click.
- Resolved ADK `ValidationError` in `main.py` by correctly `await`ing `session_service.create_session()` and restructuring session initialization within the async WebSocket endpoint.

## In Progress
- Testing the fix for the ADK `ValidationError` and overall application stability.

## To Do
- Backend: Agent logic needs to be updated to close WebSocket on "Bye Friday" command for server-initiated session termination to be fully functional.
- Investigate `pcm-player-processor.js` if issues persist with audio interruption.
- Refine particle sphere animation (performance, visuals).
- Enhance styling for message display.
- Further improve robustness and error handling for Web Speech API if needed.
- Investigate any remaining causes of double WebSocket connections if the issue persists.
- Further improve UI/UX based on feedback.
