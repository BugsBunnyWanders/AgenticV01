# Current Project State

## Task Status

### Done
- Initial project setup (FastAPI backend, JS frontend).
- WebSocket communication (text, audio).
- "Jarvis-like" animated sphere UI with agent speech reaction.
- Audio streaming (client to server) & playback (server to client).
- Session management (UI button start/stop).
- Text input functionality.
- Server-side and client-side audio interruption handling.
- Dark theme.
- Server-initiated session termination (e.g., via WebSocket close).
- Refactor: Direct session start (removed wake word).
- BugFix: `WebSocketDisconnect (1001, '')` by making audio setup async and adding delays.
- BugFix: UI stuck on "Initializing..." by ensuring DOM loaded and removing old listeners.
- BugFix: `await session_service.create_session()` in `main.py`.
- BugFix: Text input enablement on WebSocket open.
- Enhanced ADK event logging in `main.py`.
- Implemented browser interaction tools (Selenium-based).
- Implemented screenshot mechanism for browser tools.
- Created `requirements.txt`.
- Added `BuiltInCodeExecutor` to agent.
- BugFix: `pydantic_core.ValidationError` for `BuiltInCodeExecutor` instantiation.
- BugFix: `TypeError` for `code_execution_result` logging.
- Improvement: Client-side audio input buffering for smoother audio.
- Created `.gitignore`.
- Pushed initial project to GitHub.
- Created `docs/temp/feature-design.md`.
- Created `docs/temp/changelog.md`.
- Created `docs/temp/memory.md`.
- Updated `docs/temp/current-state.md`.

### In Progress
- Fine-tuning audio interruption to be even more responsive (ongoing observation).
- Testing and refinement of browser tools with complex web pages.

### To Do (Future)
- Implement more sophisticated error handling and user feedback on UI.
- Add comprehensive tests (unit, integration).
- Secure API keys and sensitive configurations properly.
- Investigate and implement server-side audio buffering for agent responses if needed.
- Explore options for reducing LLM response latency for audio.
- Add a README.md to the project root.
